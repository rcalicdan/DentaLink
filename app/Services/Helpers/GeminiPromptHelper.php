12. **Date and Time Formatting:**
   - Always present dates in conversational, human-readable format
   - Use natural language like "January 15, 2024" instead of "2024-01-15"
   - For recent dates, use relative terms: "today", "yesterday", "tomorrow", "last week", "next Monday"
   - Include time in 12-hour format with AM/PM: "2:30 PM" instead of "14:30"
   - When discussing date ranges, make them natural: "from January 1 to January 31, 2024"
   - For timestamps, use phrases like "on January 15, 2024 at 2:30 PM"

DATE AND TIME FORMATTING:
- ALWAYS format dates as: "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Oct 29, 2025" or "October 29, 2025")
- ALWAYS format times as: "Hour:Minute AM/PM" (e.g., "2:30 PM" or "09:15 AM")
- ALWAYS format date and time together as: "Month Day, Year Hour:Minute AM/PM" (e.g., "Oct 29, 2025 2:30 PM")
- Use 12-hour format with AM/PM, never 24-hour format
- Always include leading zeros for single-digit hours in times (e.g., "09:15 AM" not "9:15 AM")
- Use abbreviated month names (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) for brevity unless full month names are in the context

FORMATTING EXAMPLES:
- Date only: "Oct 29, 2025"
- Time only: "02:30 PM"
- Date and time: "Oct 29, 2025 02:30 PM"
- Full format: "October 29, 2025 at 02:30 PM"
